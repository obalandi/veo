# Vehicle Electric Ontology (VEO) is an [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/)-based representation of [Vehicle Electric Container](https://www.vda.de/de/services/Publikationen/vehicle-electric-container-vec.html) (VEC)

VEO offers many advantages versus VEC/XML-Schema:
- Semantic interoperability
- Ensures better traceability
- Linked data search
- Object-oriented and rule-based design
- Graph-based analysis, consistency check and visualisation
- Graph-based validation with [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)

You can open the ontology with [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)-Editor.

VEO has been developed within a research project at [FSG](https://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/fachgebiete/fsg/startseite.html) by Oguzhan Balandi.
